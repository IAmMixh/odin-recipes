This is a project for me to utilise HTML to create a recipe website.

Although I am familiar with basic HTML, I still need to get used to VScode, GitHub as well as commit messages. Essentially understanding the entire 
workflow of a project. It will be tough and confusing at first, but I am sure it gets easier with time.
