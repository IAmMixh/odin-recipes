This is a project for me to utilise HTML to create a recipe website.

Although I am familiar with basic HTML, I still need to get used to VScode, GitHub as well as commit messages. Essentially understanding the entire 
workflow of a project. It will be tough and confusing at first, but I am sure it gets easier with time.

Post Reflection:
Overall, the process seems quite doable. I need to remember to git add and git commit frequently at every important junction. Also, I need to remember 
to git push in order to push my commit work to github itself.
